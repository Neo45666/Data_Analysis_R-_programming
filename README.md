## Background to the research

The West of England Combined Authority currently has a trial scheme in which residents can hire an e-scooter for local transport needs.
Bristol City Council are interested in potential summer demand for e-scooters based on weather, visibility, and distance from the city center. 
Data has been obtained from a city in Japan which has an e-scooter rental scheme. 
The data that has been collected from the city in Japan, is to be analysed to potentially assist Bristol City Council planning. 

## About the data

The data to be used is in the file on Blackboard titled JapanEScooterData.csv
Look at summer days, and only use daylight hours which is defined by having solar radiation (MJ/m2) values greater than 0 when the scheme was functioning.
After you have completed the instructions above for selecting the subgroup of the data to analyse, use your studentID as a seed to then select a random sample of 500 observations to use for your analyses.
You should remove any redundant variables (where only one value remains in that variable).
This subset of the data is what you should use for the rest of this assessment. You must only analyse the specified data. No other data should be considered for this assessment.
